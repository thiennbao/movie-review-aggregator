People cling too much to the original and do not see the importance of a little modernization.The dark forest was a little to much, in my opinion, it gave me a little Alice in wonderland vibes. Didn't have a lot of added value. Would have loved a little more of the storyline about the witch and the ways that she tried to kill Snow White.But overall, an amazing production. It showed a good storyline and showed al the important thing out of the original fairytail.Really loved the taks on the Dwarfs and the bandits in the Forest.",

      "sentence": "Disney's latest Snow White movie leaves behind a sense of disappointment, particularly for fans of the original 1937 animated film. The magical, Bavarian elements of the classic film, such as Snow White's traditional dirndl dress, the castle that resembles Neuschwanstein, the Black Forest setting, the Bavarian wood carvings in the dwarfs' cottage are all missing in the new adaptation. Even the Evil Queen's potion glass, a Bavarian wine glass in the original, was part of the charm that connected the film to its Southern German roots. The Yodel Song was also drastically shortened in the new film. This cultural richness contributed to the original's charm, and its absence makes the new version feel \"hollow.\"Gal Gadot has a strong presence in the film, but the brief and not-scary transformation scene of the Evil Queen was a letdown, as it was one of the standout moments in the animated film.The reason I'm giving this a 2 instead of a 1 is that the new soundtrack is actually pretty catchy. Still, even though the new film has some redeeming qualities, it overall fails to capture the magic, atmosphere, and rich German cultural elements that made the 1937 movie so beloved.",

It's not just that the lead actress seems totally miscast-the entire movie is filled with forced, unrealistic moments that completely pull you out of the story. Instead of creating something magical or meaningful, they shove in so many unnecessary changes and heavy-handed messaging that it's just exhausting to sit through. The balance between updating the story and keeping the heart of the original is completely off, making it feel more like a lecture than an actual movie.Nothing flows naturally, and the lack of coherence makes it hard to care about anything happening on screen. The forced attempts to be modern feel incredibly awkward, and rather than feeling progressive or fresh, it just comes off as hollow and unnatural. It's hard to feel invested when everything feels like it was thrown together without much thought. In the end, this Snow White isn't just a disappointment-it's a complete misfire.",

      "sentence": "Disney's 2025 live-action Snow White is an absolute trainwreck-easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. It manages to butcher a beloved classic with uninspired performances, baffling creative choices, and some of the worst casting decisions in recent memory.Let's start with the biggest disaster of them all: Gal Gadot. Somehow, she delivers an even worse performance than in Wonder Woman 1984-which I didn't think was possible. As the Evil Queen, she's neither menacing nor captivating; she's just painfully bad. Her line delivery is wooden, her facial expressions are awkward, and her attempt at villainous charm is laughable. At times, it feels like she's struggling just to remember her lines, and her singing? It's borderline offensive. She completely lacks the gravitas needed for the role, making every scene she's in a chore to sit through. Disney needs to do everyone a favor and never cast her in a major role again.Rachel Zegler, as Snow White, is equally lifeless. She doesn't embody the warmth or charm of the original character, instead coming off as entitled and irritating. The chemistry between her and the Prince (or whatever they tried to turn the love interest into) is non-existent. The film's attempt to modernize Snow White by removing core elements of her story makes her character feel directionless, further dragging the already weak script down.Visually, the movie is an eyesore. The CGI dwarfs look atrocious, the sets lack any kind of magical charm, and the whole film has this weird, cheap, over-processed aesthetic that makes it look more like a straight-to-streaming knockoff than a $200+ million Disney blockbuster.And let's not forget the music. The new songs are completely forgettable, adding nothing of value to the film. Meanwhile, any attempt at nostalgia with the classic songs is ruined by poor arrangements and even worse performances.If Disney was hoping this would breathe new life into their live-action remakes, they've failed miserably. Snow White (2025) is an insult to the original and a complete waste of time. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.",

IT is very sad that Disney decided to damage such a beautiful story line. \"Quoting Zegler: WEIRD.... WEIRD\" exactly. She was weird, and I expected Galdot to make a big difference, but i was disappointed. The face snow white made in front of the Stairs at 18 minutes.... was the culmination of my lunch. I am happy that the Theater staff was understanding with the refund, they gave us a pass to enjoy a different movie. It was disappointing but the refund and FREE ticket to watch something else made up for it. The story line was damaged with this new \"TREND\" and it failed to deliver the expected outcome. I advise that if you wish to stay for more than 30 minutes, GO with the understanding that it is NOT going to be good, the story wont make sense, the changes done by the cast are horrible and the CGI......well...i will let you guys decide for yourselves.",

Bandits ????, now forgive me but I do not recall these being in the original. It's pretty evident that these were the original magical beings or poor substitutes for the dwarves and the film couldn't structurally exist without them due to the footage that had already been filmed.The film follows certain beats from the original initially before deciding it wants to be something else, and the mediocre songs do not help either.You also know there's a massive issue with the film when they've literally dropped the 'Seven Dwarfs' from the title and simply called it 'Snow White'. The holy grail of the Disney legacy is subsequently crucified in the name of a modern re-invention of the classic and believe me I am furious that Disney didn't have the respect for the original and hired an actress in the lead who has nothing but contempt for it. Rachel has made that clear from her big mouth in numerous press junkets where they let her open it.This film is exhaustedly terrible and has no right to exist.",

This movie is an absolute travesty that fails on every level!Instead of celebrating the traditional elements that made Snow White beloved for generations, the filmmakers decided to completely alter the character dynamics in an attempt to be \"progressive.\" Newsflash: changing the essence of characters just for the sake of social commentary does NOT equal good storytelling!Snow White herself feels more like a caricature than a character. She's portrayed as a rebellious teenager, full of angst, and completely dismisses the charm that made her story enchanting. The whimsical love story is reduced to a tired trope of \"I don't need a prince,\" diminishing the emotional core of the original tale. It's like they set out to remove every ounce of magic in favor of some misguided notion of empowerment.And let's talk about the dwarfs. They've been re-imagined in a way that's not only ridiculous but also insulting. Instead of being endearing side characters, they come off as a jumbled mess of stereotypes with zero development. Their jokes fall flat, and it's clear that the writers were more focused on pseudo humor than crafting an engaging narrative.The plot twists are not only predictable but also devoid of any real stakes. By the time we got to the climax, I found myself rolling my eyes rather than feeling any tension or excitement.And the ending? Don't even get me started! It's a slap in the face to anyone who cherishes the original story.If you're looking for the magic and wonder that Snow White used to bring, you won't find it here. This adaptation has completely misunderstood the heart of the story.Save your time and money-this is not the Snow White you've been hoping for!",

Fast forward to today, and we now have this-a cinematic train wreck that takes a pickaxe to nostalgia and buries it in an unmarked grave.Let's start with the most baffling issue: the Evil Queen is more beautiful than Snow White. That's not just a nitpick; it obliterates the entire premise. Why is she jealous? Does she have self-esteem issues? Did her magic mirror get hacked? Watching this film, you'd think the real villain is common sense itself.Then there's the protagonist. Now, I don't care who plays Snow White, but at the very least, make the story make sense. The original description-skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, hair as black as ebony-isn't just some throwaway line; it's the reason the story exists. Ignoring that detail makes it feel like the writers skimmed the Wikipedia summary and said, \"Eh, close enough.\" Spoiler: It wasn't.The film is also hilariously devoid of charm. No whimsy, no heart, just a dull, self-important slog that takes itself way too seriously while simultaneously treating the source material like garbage. It's like watching a birthday clown perform Shakespeare-awkward, painful, and fundamentally wrong.The only joy I got from this experience was the memes mocking it, which ironically had more creativity than the entire film. If you want to enjoy Snow White, do yourself a favor: stick to the animated classic or, better yet, just stare at a blank wall for two hours. You'll get the same amount of plot development, but at least you won't leave feeling personally attacked.",

The good intentions in making this movie and the goal to modernize it for younger audiences can be well seen, but was it really necessary?From a song in which Snow White actually gives consent to the \"prince\" character prior to her eating the poison apple, to poor character development, inclusion of pointless characters and toning down of the Evil Queen's scary and devilish looming presence, the movie seems to be a patchwork quilt of some politically correct behavior, a not very deep story (although it tries to be), characters we know and love and some new ones we're introduced to and don't really get to know (and never do).Rachel Zeggler both acts and sings beautifully and her theme song is a show stopper. Her vocals I dare say are clearer than Halle's Part of Your World. Now, Gal Gadot (oh boy) plays a flowy and way too over the top Evil Queen, that unfortunately is but a far dying echo of the Evil Queen in the animation.Production problems and reshoots can be clearly seen when Snow White's hair distractingly changes both length and style, sometimes in the very same music sequence.Speaking of music sequence, the Evil Queen absolutely did not need songs of her own, what breaks her character and makes us lose credibility in her evilness. She just feels...goofy.I personally also felt a slight little political theme here and there, but that might just be me.That being said, again the movie is not bad. It's CUTE and endearing but a little stale, like a cookie that's not very well baked, but it still ok. The visuals and CGI are stunning and, yes, I can see some uncanny valley happening with the dwarfes but nothing distracting or creepy at all. They look amazing nonetheless and the details are jaw dropping (Dopey was actually my favorite character in the movie).However, it trying too hard to be politically correct (\"and evidently so\") and to please everyone are what make the experience only a little less enjoyable.",

I have not laughed this much in a long time at a movie.A couple of little less negative things are that the first part of the movie is almost watchable. Mainly because it is decently true to the original. Zegler is not as bad as I thought, she can actually sing. And... uh... well, that is pretty much it.Ignoring the Dwarfs for sanity reasons: Around the 30min mark or so this movie takes a very weird turn. Suddenly we are introduced to a bunch of characters (not the Dwarfs...) that will forever go down in history as the worst ever portrait on film. And from meeting those empty shells of characters it is all downhill.Although Zegler is surprisingly not completely awful for most of the film, the rest of the cast are all so bad they make The Acolyte acting look masterful in comparison. The prince, whom is not a prince at all, just a robber and thief, he kisses snow like she has the plague, and Gadot is just Gadot trying to be... I dunno, some parody of an evil queen I guess.This is about 50% true to the original, but the things they changed are so out there and so hilariously unpleasant I could not contain my laughter. This is so inapt and so badly done I cannot understand why Disney didn't shelf it or postponed it for 2 years to remake the whole thing. Someone actually approved this for the theatre. Wow. Disney... what are you doing?I give this a 2/10 because the first 20min was almost okay and because Zegler was not as horrible as I thought she would be. But make no mistake, this is one of the worst movies you will ever see. My advice is to drink a bottle or sixteen before watching because I had a pretty fun time with this movie. Do not bring the kids though, they will not like this at all.",

      "sentence": "I had high hopes for this movie, but unfortunately, it fell flat in almost every way. The plot was convoluted and poorly paced, leaving me confused and bored rather than engaged. The characters were one-dimensional, with no depth or development, making it impossible to care about their fates.The dialogue was cringe-worthy at times, filled with clich\u00e9s and awkward exchanges that felt forced. The acting didn't help either-some performances were so wooden, it was hard to believe the actors were even trying.Visually, the movie was underwhelming. The special effects looked cheap and outdated, and the cinematography lacked any creativity or flair. Even the soundtrack felt out of place, often distracting rather than enhancing the scenes.Overall, this film was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they're looking for a prime example of how not to make a movie.",
