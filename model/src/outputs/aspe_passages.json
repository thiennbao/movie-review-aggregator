Sandberg's Until Dawn arrives with a wicked grin, initially luring you in with the familiar tropes of a secluded setting and a group of young adults stumbling into potential danger.

The film pivots when the group finds themselves trapped in a time loop within a seemingly innocuous visitor center. This is where Until Dawn embraces its gaming inspiration, echoing the \"live-die-live again\" formula popularized by titles like Happy Death Day. The recurring nights, marked by a chilling hourglass, the mystery of the masked pickaxe assailant and the discovery of a hidden house deliver genuine scares and intrigue. However, as the nights bleed into one another, Until Dawn unfortunately begins to lose its way. While the time loop mechanic provides ample opportunities for creative and gruesome deaths, the film frustratingly neglects to fully explore the initial driving force: Melanie's disappearance. The urgency of finding her gets somewhat lost in the story telling. Until Dawn offers a thrilling, albeit slightly uneven, ride. It successfully captures the spirit of making crucial decisions with life-or-death consequences, reminiscent of its gaming namesake (which may be ahead of its time, or just fly over peoples heads).

Through multiple viewpoints, the movie gradually funnels you toward a singular, unavoidable truth\u2014one that resonates with startling logic and profound empathy. Each frame pulses with authenticity, pulling us into a world where women grapple against the suffocating grip of a male-dominated society. The brilliance lies in its restraint: every moment you anticipate relief or resolution, the film gently yet ruthlessly reminds you of the relentless logic imposed by tradition, one that's skewed, oppressive, and heartbreakingly entrenched. It underscores the tragedy of generational silence, where women's voices are systematically muted by the old guard's relentless grip on power.

Bong Joon-ho lets his imagination run wild, unleashing a satirical and visionary science fiction extravaganza. Robert Pattinson fully commits to the role.

This is a trope that rarely works, and it doesn\u2019t work here since it serves no purpose other than spoiling something. From there on, it is very good, but sputters into terrible territory over the course of two plus hours. It\u2019s all because the script has scenes that happen, but offers no answers to hundreds of questions that a thinking person has. What we know is that two brothers have either fled or left the Al Capone gang to start a juke joint business or one-night party in their home town in Mississippi. They decide to, all in one day for no reason, purchase a venue, pay someone to make a sign, find a musician, find a chef, and find patrons. Why this is all done in one day is a giant flaw that could\u2019ve been handled in an interesting way. Over an hour later we get our first appearance of the Irish vampire who drops into frame in the middle of the day in the middle of nowhere. The reason this happens would be good to know, but is not mentioned. The rest of the film introduce scenes that start off great, but then make no sense. A great example of this is the large song sequence. The movie has an attempt at a theme of the love and appreciation of blues music. A musical number starts and rather than the characters experiencing this theme, it\u2019s just for the audience to see the past history of music and future. The future \u201cglorification\u201d of music, doesn\u2019t tie in with the characters and serves only to confuse the viewer. There\u2019s a vision of the barn burning down that the vampires see, but this doesn\u2019t tie into the story like it is set up to. Ultimately the vampires would rather sing and dance than really try to infiltrate the party, thus the only real vampire action happens in one scene that has no direction. Vampires and humans entangle in a stupid fight that just happens without suspense or believability. I could literally post a few hundred questions that highlight all the issues. Why were the guns not in the juke joint? Why did the vampires prance around until daylight? Why involve the KKK in such a shallow way? Why even have vampires? Why did a character slice his arms open to attract vampires that were already coming for him, and why did he act so stupidly (along with the girl) when it came to the garlic eating scene? I will reach a character limit on this review of if I keep going. Ultimately, the characters had no sense of end goals and any attempt at themes are never gone beyond a slight mention. Yes, it\u2019s well made for the most part when it comes to acting and cinematography, even though some scenes are lit terribly and cgi stands out in scenes where it shouldn\u2019t, but the script is one of the worst of the year.

However the film lacks the bravado with its various Freaky Tales to connect the pieces into a unified whole.\noutput: ", "input: Ryan Coogler's SINNERS is an electrifying original vampire story with exceptional performances from the entire ensemble that features stunning music and an ending I'm still thinking about.\noutput: ", "input: Great story, acting and of course, suspense. We loved Michael B. as twins, Smoke and Stack. The dude who played the main vampire was creepy scary. Stay until the very, very end!\noutput: ", "input: Ponderous and pretentious, \u201cMickey 17\u201d is a dull, insufferably smug sci-fi parable about class division, colonialism, political cultism, cloning, speciocide and religious mania, all in one package.  It\u2019s also supposed to be funny.\noutput: ", "input: The \u201ccalling up the spirits\u201d sequence is spectacular.\noutput: ", "input: Mickey 17 may not end up being the year\u2019s best film, but it will undoubtedly become one of its most essential.\noutput: ", "input: Sinners earns comparisons to boozy genre films From Dusk Till Dawn and Demon Knight, but there's also a Tarantino-esque historical anger \u00e0 la Django Unchained or Inglourious Basterds.\noutput: ", "input: When I watched this, the theatre was about empty (perhaps only around 20% occupancy) which was unusual for this kind of film featuring popular stories and casts. The film is basically visually stunning, but the casting is a disaster. Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot completely miss the mark-Zegler's performance feels totally forced, to be honest it was hard to watch, and Gadot lacks the menace needed for the Evil Queen. Strangely, the supporting cast feels more natural than the leads. The CGI, though, is amazing-the enchanted forest and Disney-style animal companions are a highlight. The story was altered to fit modern culture, which isn't the real issue-the weak performances are. A visually beautiful yet ultimately disappointing adaptation.\noutput: ", "input: A tasteful parody of humanity that happens to take place in space. Bong Joon-ho\u2019s writing points and laughs at society while demanding sympathy for its unassuming participants.\noutput: ", "input: ahh scary and now they have to do it again???\noutput: ", "input: It\u2019s not a movie that\u2019s trying to prove or convince you of anything, but rather one wholly devoted to building on what inspired it, paying homage, keeping it funky and freaky, entertaining as hell.\noutput: ", "input: There are many, many reasons to like Sinners \u2013 which is, for my money, Coogler\u2019s very best film to date \u2013 but first among them is the way the film careens through several wildly different genres and somehow still comes out of it as a cohesive whole.\noutput: ", "input: The acting in this movie is top notch.\noutput: ", "input: The movie\u2019s alive, and the actors seize the day, from Mosaku\u2019s grave and beautifully modulated Annie to Steinfeld\u2019s note-perfect embodiment of a femme fatale who\u2019s fatale in unusual ways.\noutput: ", "input: Freaky Tales\u2019s a genuine shame that such a clearly personal project for the filmmakers gets so lost.\noutput: ", "input: 10/10 NO NOTES! So many layers I was truly moved. Haven\u2019t had a movie make me feel like THAT in years. Give them every single award!\noutput: ", "input: In combining the old genre tropes with a potent message \u2014 the eternal recipe for a great horror film \u2014 the ever-entertaining director again shows he has something forceful to say, be it with boxers, superheroes or blood-suckin\u2019 vampires.\noutput: "]
